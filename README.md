Spark Projection on Wikipedia Database

In project, I implemented Spark by exploring full-text Wikipedia articles.

Gauging how popular a programming language is important for companies judging whether or not they should adopt an emerging programming language. For that reason, industry analyst firm RedMonk has bi-annually computed a ranking of programming language popularity using a variety of data sources, typically from websites like GitHub and StackOverflow. See their top-20 ranking for June 2016 as an example.

I used the full-text data from [Wikipedia](http://alaska.epfl.ch/~dockermoocs/bigdata/wikipedia.dat) to produce a rudimentary metric of how popular a programming language is, in an effort to see if the Wikipedia-based rankings bear any relation to the popular Red Monk rankings.
